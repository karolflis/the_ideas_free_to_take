Guidelines on: Integrating new technology/software - the process.

*** Introduction phase:

 * Each office or team has a short introduciton meeting (i.e. 15-25 minutes):
 ** Short presentation/talk - what it is, why we want it, what problems it solves, what problems it introduces.
 ** Describing risk scope - which client/who will use it, what teams will be involved in managing/fixing/debugging or developing it.

*** Learning phase:

 * Teams involved using new technology are subject to self basic training: reading documentation and other materials on the topic (i.e. 1h should be fine for having basic overview).
 * Assigning one person for expertise. Related tasks should go through this person, he/she is meant to learn specifics and pass the knowledge to the team.
   This is not to be 1-bus factor - selected person will be responsible for assisting collegues with solving problems and creating documentation/learning materials on wiki.
 * Any hands-on experience with resolving issues, gotchas and support is written down (i.e. to wiki)

*** Post-live/Overview phase:

 * Any issues or topics worth mentioning are presented, talked through at internal meetings (we have it every 1-3 weeks), any specials can be brought on global dev meeting
